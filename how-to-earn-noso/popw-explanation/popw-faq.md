<summary>Can i earn Noso with multiple devices?</summary>

Yes, But the way PoPW works is  <mark style="color:red;">**ONE NosoAddress to ONE UNIQUE IP**</mark>  so if one participant joins, and gives all the shares to all the pools(currently 4), he will get the maximum reward given by the system\ <mark style="color:red;">****</mark>
