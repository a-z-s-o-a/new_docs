# PoPW Net AI

### <mark style="color:yellow;">The Noso Popwnet goal is equitable coin distribution rewarding preferred participation with a heavier weight over non preferred. PoPWnet ruleset is as follows.</mark>



1. PoPW net rolling behavior control period 24 blocks (in each new block, all calculations are made, for all addresses that have appeared in at least one block in this period)
2. Initial participation multiplier 0.76 (100-24)
3. Participation in block bonus 0.01/Block (someone who has participated in the last 24 blocks, in the period of 24 blocks, has a cumulative bonus of 0.24)) base 0.76+bonus 0.24 = 1
4. Allowed number of different IP addresses in this period is 4 (if this limit is exceeded, the multiplier drops to 0, until the delivery of blocks falls below the limit).
5. Restriction 1 IP/Noso Address (more IPs/Noso Addresses, will exceed the limit mentioned above (4), and will be blocked, until it returns below the limit).
6. The penalty for each banned IP (VPN/VPS/etc.) is, blocking the use of the illegal IP, and a reduction in the multiplier of 0.3 (engagement of 3 illegal IPs, in a period, drops the multiplier to 0.1).
