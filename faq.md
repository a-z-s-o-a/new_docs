<summary>what is JSON-RPC?</summary>

A Noso Remote Procedure Call (RPC) node is a type server that allows users to read data on the Noso blockchain and manipulate it for various purposes. Full details [here](https://docs.nosocoin.com/noso-developers-portal/rpc-connection/running-a-noso-rpc-node-for-development) (for exchanges)

<summary><strong>Why is noso.exe and consominer2.exe flagged as a virus?</strong></summary>

In the last decade or so, the anti-virus software began using a method called heuristics to better detect viruses that had code to evade detection. While that helped with a better detection, it also came with the undesirable side effect of false positives. This happens more often with non-signed software that has code to access the Internet. Since both, the wallet and the earning app do access the Internet, they trigger a false positive. They do not have a virus, they just tickle the anti-virus software the wrong way.
