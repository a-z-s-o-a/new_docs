# üèò Noso Governance (GVT)

Built into Noso protocol is a Governance Token (GVT) poll management system. This system allows GVT owners to create project related polls for consideration which are voted upon by other GVT owners. In order to participate in the voting process, an individual must acquire through purchase or trade, a Noso Governance Token (GVT). These tokens are available to anyone wanting to participate in the voting process. Currently if you would like to purchase a GVT you must reach out to a moderator or developer from the Noso project Discord.
