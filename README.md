# ðŸ‘‹ Welcome to Noso

### What is <mark style="color:yellow;">Noso</mark>? <a href="#overview" id="overview"></a>

> #### **Noso is a dynamic and sustainable Peer-to-Peer crypto currency and platform, accessible to consumers and merchants, is fast, reliable, and secure with minimal transaction costs. The Noso platform has been designed from the ground up by a team with more than a decade of experience in Blockchain technologies.**

> #### Noso has a strong focus on sustainability, scalability, and transparency. It is an open source project that aims to deliver an equitable and sustainable infrastructure for financial and social applications on a global scale.

> #### Noso uses a democratic governance system (GVT) built into Mainnet which will allow the project to evolve over time and promote contributor participation. The project will fund itself in a sustainable way through the use of project funds derived from the creation of each block.

## <mark style="color:yellow;">Who are the Founders of Noso?</mark>

Noso, a project created by an anonymous team with extensive experience in cryptography and blockchain development, was launched in December 2021 by a full-time developer. Despite the team's anonymity, their experience, combined with the complex nature of the project and its milestones (such as the creation of a new consensus mechanism in Pascal, a secure programming language), suggest that Noso was developed by experts with extensive hands-on experience in the field of cryptography.

## <mark style="color:yellow;">What makes Noso Unique?</mark>

Noso was created from the ground up to accommodate a vast number of users, providing increased dependability, scalability, confidentiality, protection, and ease of use. The approach was based on the philosophy of "if you build it, they will come", as the team prioritized the development of functional technology before turning their attention to promotion.

Noso is a unique cryptocurrency that sets itself apart from other digital currencies by addressing the limitations and flaws of its predecessors. Building upon the similarities it shares with Bitcoin, Noso has its own chain with a Genesis block and a process for creating new coins referred to as "Coinbase". However, Noso goes further by dividing the newly minted coins into three categories and implementing innovative solutions to enhance scalability and speed. Unlike other cryptocurrencies that slow down as the blockchain ledger grows, Noso separates the Merkel tree and address balances from the blockchain, allowing for faster transaction speeds up to 1900TPS. Additionally, the Noso protocol allows for blocks to be created and added to the blockchain only for the purpose of consulting transaction history, making it independent once updated. These design elements not only improve performance but also provide room for future upgrades and updates to the Noso protocol.
