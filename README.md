### Overview: <a href="#overview" id="overview"></a>

> Noso is a next generation Peer-to-Peer cryptocurrency that is accessible to consumers and merchants, is fast, reliable, and secure with minimal transaction costs. Noso has its own lightweight blockchain which is not a fork, token, or copy of any other existing code-base. With Noso‚Äôs unique ‚ÄúNosohash‚Äù algorithm and consensus ensuring decentralized masternodes (MN), the network is immune to 51% PoW attacks. Noso coins can be earned through Proof of participation on work (PoPW) on any CPU based device. The project goal is to create a unique and sustainable cryptocurrency with fair distribution that will be widely used for the payment of goods and services online, without a need for third parties or intermediaries.
