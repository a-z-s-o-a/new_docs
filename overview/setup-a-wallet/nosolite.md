# Nosolite

## Nosolite Wallet:

NosoLite wallet allows users the ability to generate new addresses, assign aliases to addresses, import or export addresses, password encrypt wallet addresses, and send and receive coins to and from other Noso coin holders. Nosolite is available for most major operating systems including Windows, Linux and macOS. Once installed, all wallets will auto-create one default address and are ready for use.

{% hint style="info" %}
Always remember to make a backup copy of your Noso wallet (Wallet.pkw) file whenever a change is made. This includes creating new addresses and adding passwords to your Noso addresses. Always store your Wallet.pkw file in a safe place. On Windows and Linux based systems, the "wallet.pkw" file is located in your _/Nosolite(root directory)/wallet/wallet.pkw_ When password protecting your Noso addresses, always use a password minimum of 8 characters to maintain compatibility between NosoLite and NosoMobile wallets.â€‹
